# project-euler-public
I maintian a private repository of my Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) solutions.
I love working on Project Euler problems and discussing solutions, but Project Euler prefers solutions not be made public.
If you'd like to see my solutions for intellectual curiosity or to see my code samples, please just ask.
